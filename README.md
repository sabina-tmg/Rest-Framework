This project is built using Django REST Framework (DRF), a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs. It includes features like authentication (Token, Session, JWT), serialization, and a browsable API interface for testing endpoints. To set up the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, and run the development server using python manage.py runserver. The APIs can be tested via Postman, cURL, or the browsable interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/. DRF simplifies API development with serializers for data conversion, viewsets for handling HTTP methods, and built-in authentication.
